It's always fun to look back on your favorite classes and think about what your favorite parts have been, so that's exactly what I'll be doing. For context, I'm currently going into the second semester of my junior year at UMBC, and have been taking one or two computer science classes per semester. Might throw in math courses and other favorites, we'll see.

# CMSC 202 - Computer Science II

This is where I started off my major - since I took AP CS A in high school. Overall, this class was pretty inoffensive - not my favorite, since it was very much the basics, but the projects were interesting enough that I didn't mind it. This one is probably a 6/10.

# CMSC 203 - Discrete Math

Another first semester course I took. This one was a lot more interesting - my interest in math coming together with my interest in computer science was great, and proofs were like individual puzzles. It took me a while to get used to solving them, but once I got the hang of it they were really interesting. Definitely an 8/10.

# MATH 152 - Calculus II

The last first semester class to review. This was quite difficult, since calculus tends to be heavy on both memorization and creativity, but the workload was reasonable and there was plenty of homework material to study with. I tend to work better self-teaching math, though, so the class itself wasn't all that interesting. The material was interesting, and it was fascinating to see how integrals went from simple solutions to puzzles, with just a few changes. A 7/10 for me.
