I'm Samuel McCarthy, a Computer Science student with a minor in Mathematics at UMBC. Thank you for taking a look at my website!

This is intended as a side project, where I can put any random thoughts, or information on how projects are going. I've always thought blogs were some of the best parts of the internet, and so I created this.

## Questions that haven't been asked, but I'll answer anyway

> Whose cat is that?

In December of 2023, I went on a trip with family to Japan. During that trip, I wound up in a cat cafe in Shibuya, and took some photos of them. I found this white cat in particular quite pretty, so I thought the photo would make a good profile picture.

The cat cafe was at `Japan, 〒150-0042 Tokyo, Shibuya, Udagawacho, 32−12, Assorti Shibuya, 8F`, so if you're in Shibuya, see if they're there!

> Why did you start programming?

It's amazing to see the effort that you put into writing detailed instructions come to fruition. Seeing every gear fit together, and seeing every puzzle piece interlock - I don't think there's any feeling like it.

> Why minor in math?

Since I was a kid, I've always loved math. I think it's the process of solving - putting together all that you know and finding the final solution. It's similar to why I enjoy programming, but programming wins. I find math to be a little too abstract for me.

> Favorite thing to cook?

I've been enjoying making crepes recently.

> Favorite language?

English, because it's the only one I know.
Kidding! Probably C++. Rust is also pretty neat.

> Last question - why a blog?

I talk a lot, so being able to put down my ideas is always nice. And, frankly, I missed writing, and it seemed like a nice hobby to try out.
