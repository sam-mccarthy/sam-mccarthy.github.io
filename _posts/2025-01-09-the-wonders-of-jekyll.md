# A welcome

Welcome to my website / blog! Although not technically my first post (I wrote the class reviews first), I'll be using this one as a welcome post. I'm Samuel McCarthy, currently a junior Computer Science major at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. I've been thinking that I need a good spot to put my thoughts, and somewhere I can talk about my projects without clogging README files, so this seemed like a good place to do it.

# Github Pages

This website is hosted on Github Pages, since I find that it works incredibly well with Jekyll and is overall an enjoyable experience. I'm considering getting a domain to attach this website to, but for the meantime, we're sticking to the good ol' .github.io domain. I'll update this post whenever that happens.

# Jekyll

When I was setting up the site through Github Pages, I discovered Jekyll, and decided to look into it. After setting up the base repo, I was attracted to the idea of being able to generate a blog entirely from Markdown files and some configuration, and ended up really enjoying the setup process. The repo builds using Github Actions, and if you're interested, you can take a look at [the Github repository](https://github.com/sam-mccarthy/sam-mccarthy.github.io/).

It took me a little bit to find a nice theme, but I ended up deciding on the elegant [Klis√© theme](https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise), for its simplicity and beauty. There are a couple issues with it, from what I can tell - the footer is static, so you have to override the theme file for it, and the dark-mode button doesn't seem to work - not on Firefox, at least.

But, alas, that concludes this welcome of sorts. Always appreciate anyone taking a look at these posts! I'll be seeing what more can be done with Jekyll - I'm thinking a Javascript simulation embedded in a blog post sounds fun.
